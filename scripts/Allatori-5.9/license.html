Redistributables, provided that such copies are made from the original copy of the Software Product or the copy
transferred to a hard disk. Copies of Redistributables may only be distributed with and for the sole purpose of

reformat or recombine the original distribution format of redistributables provided by Smardec. However Smardec will
not support or have any liability for such use.
